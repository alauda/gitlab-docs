#### AML Template

Before this update, deploying a Gitlab instance with LFS support required first using a template to deploy Gitlab and then manually configuring the LFS feature according to the product documentation, which was complex and error-prone. With this update, you can directly use the `AML Template` to deploy a Gitlab instance with built-in LFS support, simplifying the process and reducing the risk of configuration errors.
